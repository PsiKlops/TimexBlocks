My first and only attempt at programming the Timex Ironman watch a while back. 

When I got the watch I was a bit ambitious about programming dates, shopping list reminders etc, but the first  thing I tried was to implement a  well known Russian Blocks game ;)
It was an interesting project working within the limitations of the M851 assembly and balancing the resources across different states. But after this I didn't feel like doing anything else with it.
It worked well enough I never got round to speeding it up as it went along and there was a strange bug I could never track down where it would not drop the blocks after a day or so as if it had a timer overrunning, might be some sort of 16 bit timeout?
